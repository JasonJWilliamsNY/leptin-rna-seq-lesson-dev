Jason Williams	williams@cshl.edu	Use DNA Subway to analyze RNA-Seq Data	"Jason Williams, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
Another Author, Somewhere Else University"	"Jason Williams, williams@cshl.edu"	"DNA Subway, an educational bioinformatics platform developed by CyVerse. It bundles research-grade bioinformatics tools, high-performance computing, and databases into workflows with an easy-to-use interface. �Riding� DNA Subway lines, students can predict and annotate genes in up to 150kb of DNA (Red Line), identify homologs in sequenced genomes (Yellow Line), identify species using DNA barcodes and phylogenetic trees (Blue Line), and examine RNA-Seq datasets for differential transcript abundance (Green Line). The tools and resources provided by this platform enabled course-based research experiences and enables thousands of students to participate in distributed research projects."
