3. The JupyterLab session will be active for 48 hours. After then, the lesson
   will automatically terminate. Any files altered/created will be automatically
   stored back to the |CyVerse Data Store|.

Data Management on CyVerse
------------------------------

Before launching a JupyterLab session, you can also elect to include specific
datasets not included in this lesson. You may also want to move data to or
from the JupyterLab session after you have started it. Learn more about Data
transfers from learning materials on |CyVerse Data Store| and |CyVerse VICE|.
