GEA Lesson Template Word
========================

This template allows you to design a lesson in a word document and have
it displayed online as a GEA lesson. Although most instructors are very
comfortable working in Microsoft Word, this format presents some
challenges in formatting (e.g. images and tables may move or be hard to
adjust) and translating to other document types (e.g. making a PDF is
easy but translating a Word document into an online lesson is
challenging).

By following this template as closely as possible, it will be easier to
make a lesson that is simply formatted, and available in a variety of
document types. A lesson maintainer will work from your template to
create the final documents.

Tips and instructions

1. To submit a lesson, fill out a coversheet form:
   https://forms.gle/GF5kD9fD6CPHcCXs9

    This form contains metadata we need to categorize and describe your
    lesson in a uniform way.

1. Placeholder section headings, tables, etc. are present below. Copy
   and paste these to add as many as are needed for your lesson.

2. Overwrite the placeholders – try to keep any formatting you do as
   simple as possible (bold, italics, etc. are fine but try to avoid
   lots of text shadows, etc.)

3. For all images/screenshots

   a. Choose high resolution files where possible .png is the preferred
      format for images

   b. Do not insert figures into the template. Instead, writ
      **[image\_X.png]** where X is the image number in the document
      (e.g. image\_1, image\_2, …). Save your images using the same name
      (e.g. image\_1.png)

On Page 2 of the lesson are some examples of preferred text formatting
and of the tables, tip boxes, etc. you can use in the lesson.

Most importantly
================

The template is not a straight-jacket. Do your best to use and stick to
the template. The editor/maintainer will correct mistakes but to the
extent that you observe the template their job will be easier.

Useful formatting reminders
===========================

Headings
========

Please use the following heading styles

Heading 1
=========

Heading 2
---------

Heading 3
~~~~~~~~~

Heading 4
^^^^^^^^^

Tables
=======

Please use simple, unformatted tables

+------------+------------+------------+
| Header 1   | Header 2   | Header 3   |
+============+============+============+
+------------+------------+------------+

Images
======

Do not put images in the text indicate approximately where you want them
in the text using notation [image\_1.png].

Tip Boxes/Callouts/code
=======================

-  You can have tip boxes and call outs with the following titles:
   Attention, caution, danger, error, hint, important, note, tip,
   warning. **Begin and end** any section you want in call out with
   [callout\_calloutname]:

   [ callout\_warning ] This text is about the warning [
   callout\_warning ]

   You can also have a call out for sample data (i.e. specific
   instructions on how a step should be followed given a provided data
   set).

-  For any text that should appear as code, **begin and end** those
   sections with the notation [code\_language] when language is the
   language of the code such as bash, R, Python, etc. eg:

   [code\_bash] $ cd /home/gea\_user/directory [code\_bash]

Answer Keys/Glossary
====================

-  **Inline questions**: minor questions with inline answers can be
   called out. Use Q and A to indicate which text is part of the
   question and which is part of the answer.

   [inline\_question] **Q:** test of question? A: text of answer
   [inline\_question]

-  **Major questions:** At the end of the template is a section for
   answer keys. Please be sure all notated questions are sequentially
   numbered in the lesson and place the corresponding question answers
   in this section. The Answer Keys will not be published publicly
   online.

-  **Glossary**: For words you want linked to a glossary use the callout
   [glossary] term before and after the word(s). The word will be linked
   to a glossary item in the glossary section.
